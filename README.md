# AngularBookManager

This is a Book Manager application built with Angular. The main objective of this project was to deepen understanding of Angular fundamentals by creating a CRUD interface to manage a list of books.

The app allows users to add, edit, and delete books with built-in validation to prevent duplicate entries. Angular services are used for data handling and reactive forms ensure a dynamic user experience.

For styling, Bootstrap was used to create a clean and responsive layout. Angular Material was also integrated for toast-style notifications, enhancing the user feedback and interface interactivity.

This project was part of a learning journey before moving on to more complex Angular applications.
